Joemon, First I think you are referring to inequality based on genetics as pushed by right wing and racists. 
That is not what is referred as genetics here. This is not Bernard Shaw or Nietzsche’s superman. I think Tipsy wasn’t referring to it either. 

What I was referring wrt nature and nurture is: there is an emerging field of study called [epigenetics]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics).

Nurture especailly at early stages of life and even things you had been doing for last few years can change your genes and can influence your “current behavior”. 
There are debates on how much epigenetics can help as well.

The point here is epigenetics says your gene matters and at the same time it can be changed (to some extend) by doing the things that helps.
If gene had not effect, then there is no need to try to change it right.

Genetic advantages/disadvantages shows up in  extremes : highly competitive fields with limited span to reach and 
stay at the top (Sports, for example NBA). These are contraversial topics and people can then discriminate based on that.

Also another related field is Cognitive and Developmental Psychology. Where they do research on kids with developmental and social difficulties. One of the top guys who had been pushing to look at genetic effects is Steven Pinker. 
He talks about the politics of the issue as well. (Book :- Blank Slate : Steven Pinker). This is the politics that I was refering to!

Please do give references to the experts in genetics rather than experts in some other fields. 
Should we read a book on mechanical engineering for brain surgery, yes of course there is some mechanics in brain surgery.
 Harari is a historian and I am not sure how much he can offer on genetics. 
This is a common problem in debating contentious issues: Eg, Takes Phd in physics and then comments on Ethics. 
And people accept it: Personally, I think it is a crude form of appeal to authority. 
People give them credibility because of their expertise in another field (he is smart so he should know better). 
Many philosophers had been talking against it for decades...!

 I skipped reading his book before, because from his lectures it sounded more closer to higher form of [behaviorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism) for me. Context: Behaviorism was known to be not ideal to represent human behavior thru failures in creating AGI with conscience by Computer Scientist.
 In any case I read a summary of that book online since you mentioned it…Here is two things I found…

1. Over the last 200 years, science has increasingly revealed that human behavior is determined by hormones, genes, and neurological synapses. 
  If this is true, then for how much longer will we ignore that biology does not agree with the concept of free will?

2. Genetic engineering is allowing humans to break the laws of natural selection.

I couldn’t find in the summary anything related to genes other than things in similar lines. 
This is much more than just epigenetics. Why genetic engineering is needed if nurture is good enough?. 
Will read his book sometime….

Also, I would think he has to support genetic effects for his  orientation...!. 
It is considered that orientation is due to genetics. If anyone says otherwise... well 
then you are gonna get …..SKRWD real bad!. It is illegal to change that thru therapy as well..!

I came to know about some of these things as my wife did MS(Psychology) in US and heard a lot about the politics behind things like this...
